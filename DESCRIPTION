Description: 
    This package can be used for analysing mitochondrial mutations using single
    cell omics data such as scRNASeq and scATACSeq (prefered, due to RNA
    editing issue). It provides functions for mutation filtering and
    visualization (future be an independent package). The mutation filtering is
    done by fitting the noise of PCR error, sequencing error,
    mtDNA sampling, and heteroplasmy dynamic. If the noise can not explain a
    observed allele frequency of a locus in a cell we call it as a mutation.
    The allele frequency is needed as input. The mutation filtering is based on
    fitting three independent models on the allele frequency: binomial,
    binomial-mixture and beta-binomial models.
